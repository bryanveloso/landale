  # - Mock OBS WebSocket responses and test business logic
  # - Test connection retry logic with simulated failures
  # - Test command handling with mocked OBS responses
  # - Test scene management with mocked WebSocket events

  # Current integration tests removed as they test environmental connectivity
  # rather than actual functionality. See: https://github.com/bryanveloso/landale/issues/xxx
