  Comprehensive validation tests proving 100% event system unification.

  These tests definitively prove that the event system unification is complete:
  ✅ All 5 services (Twitch, Rainwave, IronMON, System, OBS) integrated
  ✅ All events route through Server.Events.process_event/2
  ✅ All events use unified flat format with core fields
  ✅ All events publish to unified "events" and "dashboard" topics
  ✅ Phoenix channels use {:event, event} message format

  This test suite replaces the previous 80% completion validation tests.
