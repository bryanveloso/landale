# Landale Overlay System

This is the **Landale Overlay System**, the continuing culmination of my efforts over the past decade to create an overlay system [for my Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/avalonstar). It is a series of components and tools that are used in conjunction with OBS Studio to support the games I play and the content I create. This is not meant to be a general-purpose overlay system, as it is highly specialized for my needs, but it's public so that you can see how I've built it.

## Features

TBD.

## History

### Why Landale?

**Landale** is the name of the ship from the Sega Genesis-era RPG Phantasy Star IV. It's also the last name of the titular character from the original Phantasy Star, Alis Landale.

## Installation

The LOS takes advantage of a lot of the baked-in functionality of the [Bun](https://bun.sh) JavaScript runtime. 

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```
