P1 HIGH Priority WebSocket Client Resilience Tests

Comprehensive test suite for BaseWebSocketClient resilience patterns including:
- Exponential backoff with jitter validation
- Circuit breaker state machine testing  
- Heartbeat monitoring and failure detection
- Connection state consistency under concurrent operations
- Background task cleanup and memory leak prevention
- Network interruption simulation and recovery

These tests prevent production issues during network instability or service restarts.
